# Supervised_Learning_Credit_Risk
An analysis of LendingClub loan data in which we apply several supervised learning models to solve a classification problem - 
predict whether a loan will default or not, given characteristics of the loan borrower. 
We applied models including XGBoost, logistic regression, ridge regression, and support vector machines.
